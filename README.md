# Project 2 - *New York Times Article Search*

**New York Times Article Search** is an android app that allows a user to search for images on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.
* [x] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results (Use an icon and the title is "Search Filter")
* [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
  * [x] Begin Date (using a date picker)
  * [x] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports)
  * [x] Sort order (oldest or newest)
* [x] Subsequent searches have any filters applied to the search results
* [x] User can tap on any image in results to see the full text of article **full-screen**
* [x] User can **scroll down to see more articles**. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [x] User can **share an article link** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [x] Replaced Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay
* [x] Improved the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [x] Use the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) with the `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` to display improve the grid of image results
* [x] For different news articles that only have text or only have images, use [Heterogenous Layouts](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) with RecyclerView
* [x] Apply the popular [Butterknife annotation library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce view boilerplate.
* [x] Leverage the popular [GSON library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Android-Async-Http-Client#decoding-with-gson-library) to streamline the parsing of JSON data.
* [x] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
  * Add ProgressBar to show animation when searching articles.
  * Add ProgressBar to show progress when loading individal articles in the
    WebView
  * Persistence of search filters using Shared Preferences. The persistence of query submitted is only used for making onLoadMore easier.
  * Collapse the SearchView upon the search button is pressed.
  * Use a button to pick a date. The button shows the date picked. (Not sure if
    it is extra, since there is no easy way to fulfill the requirement of using
    DatePicker without a button, and the button should naturaly show the picked
    date anyway)
  * "Reset" button for clearing filters.
  * Fix the issue of EndlessRecyclerViewScrollListener does not load more items
    if the network is interrupted or an API call has an error because it is
    stuck at "loading" state.
  * Hide the ToolBar when scrolling the WebView down to achieve fullscreen
    viewing of the article.
  * Search suggestions with recent queries.
  * Implement "up" navigation.
